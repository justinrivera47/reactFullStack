ReactFullStack" is an ambitious project aimed at developing a dynamic and interactive social platform. 
The primary objective of this endeavor is to design and implement a robust post application where users can engage in various social activities seamlessly.

The core functionalities of the application revolve around user registration and authentication, empowering individuals to create accounts and securely log in to the platform. 
Once logged in, users gain access to a plethora of features, including the ability to post content, react to posts with likes, and engage in discussions through comments on others' posts.

To bring this vision to life, the project leverages a diverse set of technologies and programming languages. 
CSS is utilized for styling and enhancing the visual appeal of the application's interface, ensuring an engaging user experience. 
React serves as the frontend framework, facilitating the creation of dynamic and responsive user interfaces that adapt to various screen sizes and devices.

Backend functionalities are powered by Node.js and Express, providing a robust server-side environment for handling user requests, managing data, and enforcing security measures. 
MySQL is employed as the database management system, offering a reliable and scalable solution for storing user data, posts, likes, and comments.

Additionally, Axios is utilized for making asynchronous HTTP requests, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the application. 
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is integrated to facilitate secure data exchange between different domains, ensuring smooth interactions between the client and server.

"ReactFullStack" aims to demonstrate my ability to develop an application with complex challenges.
This project is still under porgress and will soon be live.
